Solution to a turtle race problem.

Suppose we want to entertain ourselves by watching a turtle wander around randomly inside the screen. When we run the program we want the turtle and program to behave in the following way:

* The turtle begins in the center of the screen.
* Flip a coin. If its heads then turn to the left 90 degrees. If its tails then turn to the right 90 degrees.
* Take 50 steps forward.
* If the turtle has moved outside the screen then stop, otherwise go back to step 2 and repeat.
