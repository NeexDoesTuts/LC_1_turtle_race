## Solution to a turtle race problem.

Suppose we want to entertain ourselves by watching two turtles wander around randomly inside the screen. When we run the program we want the turtles and program to behave in the following way:

* The turtle begins in the center of the screen.
* Flip a coin. If its heads then turn to the left 0-90 degrees. If its tails then turn to the right 0-90 degrees. The amount of degrees to turn is randomly generated.
* Take 30 steps forward.
* If either turtle has moved outside the screen then stop, otherwise go back to step 2 and repeat.

Few generated outcomes of the race:
